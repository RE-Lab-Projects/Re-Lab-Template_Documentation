Linting
=======
Linting is the process of forcing a specific format to source code. The propposed linting method for these projects is the official `Python pep8 linting <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
There are two ways of ensuring linting:

From command line
-----------------

From the project rootfolder run pylint or black. Mind that black will change files unprompted.

IDE integration
---------------
Refer to the `pylint manual <https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/ide-integration.html>`_ for how to integrate pylint into your IDE.
